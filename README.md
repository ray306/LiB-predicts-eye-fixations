# LiB-predicts-eye-fixations

#### Anaylsis code
See `[Open It] LiB_evaluation_on_GECO.ipynb`. 

#### The LiB model code
`LiB.py` is the main script of the LiB model. It depends on `structures.py`, which defines the basic data structure of LiB. 

#### The AG model & the CBL model
See `Other models`.

#### Data files
The files without name extension are the pre-processed corpora and eye-fixation data of GECO. 
Since the file size limitation of Github, the pre-processed large corpora (COCA and SoNaR) are uploaded to https://osf.io/ydr7w/.
